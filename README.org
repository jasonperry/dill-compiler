*Dill* is a statically typed programming language to capture how
I want to write and read imperative code. It's meant to be
type- and memory-safe, with a good orthogonal set of type-based
abstractions, with as close to zero runtime overhead as possible. The
most interesting feature is how it makes mutability visible and simplifies management of the value/reference distinction. 
Goals and features include:
- "Imperative locally, immutable-first globally"; local variables are reassignable, but datatypes are immutable by default, and procedure arguments are passed immutably by default and are not reassignable.
- Non-local mutation is made explicit; passing an object mutably is
  indicated at both the function definition and call site. Otherwise
  "deep" immutability is enforced.
- No implicit differences in behavior due to using values
  vs. references; explicit mutability reduces the number of places where
  you have to think about the distinction. You can declare a local ~ref~
  variable, but for function arguments the mutability distinction is
  enough.  Assignment of a mutable object to a ~var~ is always a copy,
  but you have to write an explicit ~copy()~ for dynamically-sized types.
- Record (struct) types are primary. Current code has labeled variants, but I'm switching that to union types with case  splitting on the type. Recursive types.
- All types are datatypes; there are no classes (containers for
  a type and methods), though method call syntax is planned. Method call syntax also distinguishes mutating and non-mutating functions.
- Null-safety with explicit nullable (option) types; syntax
  and value promotion convenience features
- Syntax: no curly braces, no significant whitespace. Blocks are  opened by a keyword or equal sign, closed by a slashed keyword:  ~/if~, ~/while~. Avoid being as verbose as Pascal/Ada, but  readability and consistency are more important. Semicolons as  statement terminators. Making code easy to type and even read aloud are also goals.
- Modules as the primary construct for code grouping and data
  hiding. ~private~ means private to a module; functions in a
  module can access private fields of datatypes in that module. All
  imports must be explicitly specified.
- Separate compilation by means of auto-generated module
  specifications. This is strictly a compiler feature---module specs are not part of the language definition proper. What a module exposes is completely specified by its source.
- In progress: generics, with constraints by means of module signatures (the
  modular equivalent of interfaces). Module imports explicitly specify
  which signature implementations you're using.
- Planned: coroutines, probably stackless. 

We'll see how far I get. The backend is LLVM with the Boehm garbage
collector, currently targeting only x86-64.

- Planned: passing procedure references. We'll see if it makes sense to
  go with full first-class/anonymous functions. If so, we'll introduce a
  pure function syntax and only allow those to be
  first-class. Procedures will never be nested.
